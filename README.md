# Portfolio_page

https://tiago-vitali.github.io/Portfolio-Page/

This repository was created with the aim of developing a page to display my personal projects in a more elegant way. To build it, I downloaded a free template from the website https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/ and made the necessary edits to the code. 

### I would like to thank the Data Science Academy (https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/) who was my mentor in the development of this project.
